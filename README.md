# Image-Similarity-FastAPI
Practice using FastAPI by turning my image similarity program into an api endpoint to get a similarity score for two images.

You are able to choose which metrics to use for total similarity score calculation by setting their values in the API call to 0 (don't use) or 1 (use).
